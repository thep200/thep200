The first internet nickname I ever used was thep200. For the record, my name is Thep. I am able to utilize `PHP`, `Vanilla JavaScript`, `Python`, `R`, and `Machine learning` in my work.. This is my thesis project [ðŸ¤– Method to automatic detection and measurement of nuchal translucency](https://github.com/thep200/thesis-thepuet-2022).
