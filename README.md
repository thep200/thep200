# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Thep. thep200 was the first nickname when I created an account on the internet. Currently, I am a full-stack web developer at a software company in Hanoi, Vietnam. Two things that most interest me are books and bushcraft, and I love my family too. I like creativity, I can use programming languages like `PHP`, `Python`, `C++` in `Unity`, `C#`, and `Javascripts`. `Vuejs` and `Laravel` are the two frameworks I am currently using the most. I am interested in math, research directions were my initial direction and I am still studying in this direction, you can view my graduation thesis here [ðŸ¤– Method to automatic detection and measurement of nuchal translucency](https://github.com/thep200/thesis-thepuet-2022). Visit over here to get [my resume](https://thep200.github.io/my-intro-page/). Thanks ðŸª²!
